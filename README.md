# TFT Display for STM32

This library was created for STM32F0xx series but it can be modified for the other STM32 series.

The data sheet for TFT Display can be found [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/JD-T1800.pdf) and the datasheet for the display driver chip can be found [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ST7735R_V0.2.pdf).

The TFT Display was controlled by STM32F030K6Tx using SPI communication protocol.


## Getting Started

**To include this library, add** `#include "TFT_DISPLAY.h"` **at the begging of the code.**

**To include the HAL Library, add** `#include "stm32f0xx_hal.h"` **at the begging of the code.**
